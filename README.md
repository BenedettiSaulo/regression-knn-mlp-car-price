# Car Price Prediction Project 🚗📊

This project uses Machine Learning models to predict car prices based on several features from a real dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of different regression algorithms and analyze their results.

## 🔍 Overview

This project applies three regression models using **Scikit-Learn**:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

It also includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis with Seaborn**, and **model performance comparison** using R², MAE, and RMSE.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Correlation heatmap
- Box plots
- Frequency plots

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is [Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) from Kaggle, which contains specifications and prices of different car models.
